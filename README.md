----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you car consult the front part of my *Rent car site* project. It have to be combinated with the repository called **BackBC** which is the bakc part of this web appli.

It contain few valuable typecript functionality, and others about data binding :

- `httpClient` for API call,
- `BehaviourSubjects` to increase performing, including pagination,
- A special component about 6 car reaserch filters combinated with scrolls and sliders,
- A component to fiew 7 `bootstrap cards` presenting the mosts recent cars entered into the web appli.

## Security

These are two aspects aoubt security :
1. A login page for professionals to enter the intraner part, wher they can manage thier garages and ads on CRUD model.
2. To access database, the web appli use a `JWT token` to avoid csrf attack.
